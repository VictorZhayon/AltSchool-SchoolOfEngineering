    <h2>Basic Information About Me</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Victor Zion</li>
        <li><strong>ALT School ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/025/4407</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I joined the AltSchool School of Engineering program because I have always been fascinated by how technology shapes our world and improves lives. 
        Over the years, I have developed a strong interest in software development, but I realized that to truly excel, I needed a structured environment where I could learn from experienced mentors and collaborate with like-minded peers. 
        AltSchool's hands-on approach, focus on real-world projects, and supportive community made it the perfect place for me to grow both personally and professionally.
        My goals for the program are to build a solid foundation in computer science principles and gain practical experience by working on challenging projects. 
        I want to improve my problem-solving skills, learn best practices in software engineering, and become proficient in modern tools and technologies. 
        Additionally, I hope to connect with other passionate learners, expand my professional network, and prepare myself for a successful career in tech. 
        Ultimately, I want to use the knowledge and skills I acquire to create solutions that have a positive impact on society.
